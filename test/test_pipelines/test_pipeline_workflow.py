"""testing class aims to test use cases where a test function has a shared parameter,
but the field in the DataFrame only has one field that is under the shared parameter.

For example, if a function has parameters(id, based_shared_field, static_field), then
we would expect that a dataframe that only had one column under that shared parameter (because
currently, the logic dictates that if no matching name is found, look at the base
of the word `shared_field`) would be a static field.

An example that got caught: `check_function_net_income(stock_gross_income, stock_expenses)`.
This was passed to a DataFrame that only had the following fields: `tsm_gross_income`, `tsm_expenses`.
Don't remember the error code but would want to catch these types of errors.
